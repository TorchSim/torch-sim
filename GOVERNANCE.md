# **Governance**

TorchSim is an open-source project spun out of Radical AI. It is supported by Radical AI, Globus Labs at The University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory, and a growing global community. We actively invite contributions, discussion, and feedback from anyone interested.

## **Governance Model**

The project is guided by a **Steering Committee** representing Radical AI, Globus Labs, and the original TorchSim team. It currently consists of:

* Rhys Goodall (Radical AI)  
* Will Engler (Globus Labs, University of Chicago)  
* Orion Cohen (TorchSim co-creator)  
* Abhijeet Gangan (TorchSim co-creator)  
* Janosh Riebesell (TorchSim co-creator)

The Governance Board provides high-level direction, ensures the project stays aligned with its mission, and helps resolve disputes when consensus is difficult.

In addition to the Board, the project appoints **Maintainers**—trusted contributors who review PRs, merge changes, and mentor new contributors. Maintainers may include contractors supported by Radical AI as well as outstanding community members.

## **Governance Goals**

The four roles of the steering committee are:

* **Provide direction**: Establish and communicate a clear roadmap and vision so contributors can align on long-term goals.  
* **Settle disputes**: Offer a fair resolution mechanism for disagreements among contributors and maintainers.  
* **Cultivate community**: Clear community guidelines with actual enforcement (if needed) create a safe, collaborative space. It’s the board’s responsibility to establish guidelines and make sure they are followed.  
* **Appoint maintainers:** The Steering Committee votes to approve new TorchSim maintainers.

## **Roadmap**

The roadmap outlines the community’s vision for TorchSim and guides long-term priorities, but it is not restrictive—contributions beyond it are always welcome. Contributors propose features and improvements, which are discussed openly and refined through feedback. The Steering Committee finalizes updates to the roadmap, ensuring alignment with the project’s mission.

## **Becoming a Maintainer**

Maintainers are selected based on a consistent record of high-quality contributions and alignment with the project’s principles of openness and collaboration. Maintainers are nominated by an existing maintainer and approved by the Steering Committee.

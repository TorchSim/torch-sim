# Changelog

## v0.3.0

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release! @t-reents, @curtischong, and @CompRhys did great work squashing an issue with `SimState` concatenation. @curtischong continued his crusade to type and improve the TorchSim API. @orionarcher, @kianpu34593, and @janosh all made contributions that continue to improve package quality and usability. üöÄ

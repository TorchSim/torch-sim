## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses a Developer Certificate of Origin to ensure that all contributions are appropriately licensed.

Every commit in your pull request must be "signed off" using the `-s` or `--signoff` flag with `git commit`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

This will add a `Signed-off-by:` line to the end of your commit message. By signing off on a commit, you are certifying that you agree to the terms of the DCO.
